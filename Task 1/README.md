# Chatbot Program Description
This chatbot program is a simple conversational agent that responds to user inputs based on predefined categories. 
The bot can recognize greetings, farewells, thank you messages, questions about its well-being, and commands about the user's name.
Additionally, it can respond with default messages when it doesn't understand the input. The bot uses a memory mechanism to remember the user's name if provided and can recall it when asked.

## Key Features
Greetings and Farewells: The bot can recognize and respond to common greetings and farewells.
Acknowledgments and Thank You Messages: It responds to acknowledgments and thank you messages appropriately.
Memory for User's Name: It can remember the user's name and recall it upon request.
Default Responses: If the input is not recognized, it provides a set of default responses asking for clarification.
Randomized Responses: Responses are chosen randomly from a list to make the interaction feel more natural.
